            <p class="body">"Tonight is the one...that will have all the fireworks."—Emma Frost.
                The Hellfire Gala is the biggest event of the season, and anyone who's anyone will be in attendance. Krakoa's best and brightest are all dressed to impress in Jumbo Carnation's finest creations, and they're welcoming the Avengers, the Fantastic Four and more familiar—and shocking—faces to the party to end all parties.

                As close allies and bitter enemies rub immaculately tailored shoulders and monotonous deals are brokered, X-Force is on hand to keep the peace—and handle any undesirable gatecrashers, Krakoa's first team of X-Men is revealed to the world, and the surprises won't end there.

                Cancel any other plans—the Gala is the place to be, and you'll want to be able to say you were there.</p>
